# Time Break
Project completed in 2020 - year 2 of MSci Computer Science degree in a  5-person collaborative group project.

Welcome to Time Break: an original 2-player PvP batte arena! Use an arsenal of unique abilities, weapons and items as well as the environment itself to defeat your opponent.

The game's codebase is written in Java, and makes use of the JSFML library to support multimedia. It was initially conceptualised and created as a group academic project during my second year of the Lancaster University MSci Computer Science course.

To win the game, you must be the first player to deplete your opponent's health bar 3 times.

Please read the manual/documentation for gameplay controls and information on individual gameplay elements.
